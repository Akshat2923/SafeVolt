StaySafe is a comprehensive safety incident management system designed to help organizations track, analyze, and prevent workplace safety incidents.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

Key features:
- Dashboard with statistics and graphs

The frontend uses several UI components from the Shadcn UI library, customized for the application's needs.
